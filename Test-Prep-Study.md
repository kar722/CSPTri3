Digital Divide:
- Unequal distribution of access to technology

### 5.5 Actions
1
- Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal
  - No Copyright
  - Dedicating work to public
  - Work can be copied, repurposed, and distributed without seeking permission from the creator.
- MIT License
  - Licensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code.
- Open Source GPL License

2
- I will be using a Creative Common Lisense for my personal project so I can help future students with their Computer Scince Principles. The code from this personal repo is my legacy from this class and I want it to help CSP students to come.
- Team Repo: We are choosing the Open Source MIT license, we will allow using the code from the Kylies-disciples GitHub to be used freely only to make and distribute closed source versions.



### 5.6 Notes

Personal Identifiable Information:
- Info specific to an individual
- Can be used to steal/impersonate from somebody
- (PII) Search engines maintain history of what you search
- Search history used to suggest other websites for marketing
  - Can collect location
- GOOD
  - Can enhance the users experience
- BAD
  - Can be exploited if privacy is ignored
  - Etc. Cookies and trackers

Risks to Privacy:
- Google knows where you live, and your IP
- WiFi signal may be tracked
- Stores w/ cameras can store your image
  - All this info can be put online, which is hard to get rid of
  - This info could be used against you and it could give other info about you that you didn't intend to share

Authentication:
- Authentication measures protect devices and information form unauthorized access
  - Measures strong passwords and 2FA

Virus and Malware:
- Bad
- Can copy and gain access to your information
- Intended to harm and damage a computer
Encryption:
- Prevents unauthorized access
Decryption:
- Decoding data

### 5.6 Actions
- I have seen Personal Identifiable Information (PII) in the CSP nighthawkcodingsociety website which links to twitter, github, and other information
- I am very safe on the internet and never give my PII to strangers, but I know that if you try and look you can find some of my personal information. But other than my name, birthday, and residence, I don't think the internet has access to my PII.
- Passwords
   - Good passwords are long with a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols.
   - Bad Passwords have ties to your personal information (family names, dog name, birthday) and dictionary words.
   - 2 Factor Authentication is extremely prevalent in our soctiety today. Emais, texts, and software-based authenticators like Google Authenticator are great ways to assist with authentication
   - Unlike symmetric encryption, which uses the same secret key to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information, asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography or public-key encryption, uses mathematically linked public- and private-key pairs to encrypt and decrypt senders' and recipients' sensitive data.
   - When deploying we initally used HTTP which did not have encryption. But then we used HTTPS which is HTTP with encryption. The difference between the two protocols is that HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses.
   - Deceptive phishing is the most common type of phishing scam. In this ploy, fraudsters impersonate a legitimate company to steal people’s personal data or login credentials. Those emails use threats and a sense of urgency to scare users into doing what the attackers want.

## Week 1 Notes

### 5.3 Notes
Computing Bias
- Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
- Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
- Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development


#### 5.3 Actions

[HP computers are racist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4DT3tQqgRM)
- The owner of the computer thinks this was intentional but most likely being a bug in the software as it was not tested enough. 
- I think this happened because they tested the motion tracking of the face only using "white" models. 
- This can be very harmful and be percieved as racist and therefore should be corrected. 
- To produce a better outcome I would test the software with different face models of different types of skin color.

### 5.4 Notes 
##### Crowdsourcing
![5 4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89176673/161669347-79ef2d3d-1d8a-42b2-8f96-9160db025963.jpg)

Public Data Sets:
- Kaggle
- Google Public Datasets
- Data.gov
- Local Government
  Widespread access to info and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions and dissemination of results.

Distributed Computing:
- A ton of computers do 1 task
  Examples:
- Spotify with collab playlists
- Crowdfunding like kickstarter and GoFundMe
- Blockchain like crypto and other tokens


#### 5.4 Actions
CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
- The 150 principes students could come together and find a way to help Ukraine fight against the Russian attacks. Crowdsourcing is essentially a group working together for a common goal so we intiate this idea in our enviroment by accepting donations and spreading the word.

What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
- We could use the kids in Del Norte to work together to make Del Norte a better school and eradicate the lingering problems in our school. My final could be better with crowdsourcing as more brains can give us more ideas.

## Week 0 Notes

### 5.1 Notes
The Wii controller and iPhone have accelerometers in them.

Accelerometers
- Automobile industry drove price down
  - Used for airbag deployment and lateral movement detection
- Quadcopter "brain"

- The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations.
- Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance.
- A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different types of people or even by the same person.
- People Create Computing innovations.
- Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts.

Least likely to be provided by the upgraded system: The company will be able to provide a human representative for any incoming call.

Microtransactions
- "Free" Games/Apps
- Cosmetics/Pay-to-win/Paywell to functionality
- gold, v-bucks, coins, "chips", SBUX
- Loot Boxes: banned in some countries


- Responsible programmers try to consider the unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses. 
- It is not possible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used.
- Rapid sharing of a program or running a program with a large number of users can result in significant impacts beyond the intended purpose or control of the programmer.

#### 5.1 Notes
Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing.
- Some beneficial effects of computing is that it makes a lot of things easier. By being able to effectively communicate using technology or having greater access to resources you're able to inform yourself more about the world around you. Some of the harmful effects of computing is that you tend to become too reliant on these technologies. This can provoke all sorts of health problems in the future.

Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
- The dopamine issues mentioned above are a real problem. I don’t think that it is just a conspiracy because as explained in the example, dopamine plays a big role in how we feel pleasure, and wanting to re-experience that same level of pleasure means you need a greater dopamine rush than before. This could impact many aspects of life and could result in mood swings as well.


### 5.2 Notes
Digital Divide
- Differing access to computer devices and internet based on
  - socioeconomic
    - How much money comes into the household per year
  - geographic
    - If isolated the ISPS might not provide high speed internet to house
  - demographic
    - Age
    - Religion
  - Countries
    - Computers are not that common in rural areas
    - Only small amount of websites
    - Internet is used to advocate and protect the government
    - Higher level of surveillance on the internet to protect the government
- Affect both groups and individuals
- Raises issue of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally
- Affected by the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments

#### 5.2 Actions
How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
- You can empower yourself in a digital world by staying informed about technologies and using them in your daily life. Being educated and provided with tech will help empower people in a digital environment.

How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS
- Someone that is empowered can help someone that may not be empowered by providing them with a secure network or their devices with them. For example, at Del Norte, I could give my hotspot to people that may not have strong access to the internet so that they could use online services or I can share a device with them.

Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
- Redtaping is blocking digital empowerment because it makes people have to follow additional steps in order to access information or technologies. We see this type of thing occurring in many circumstances, not necessarily in just tech. We have similar barriers at Del Norte when we try to connect ourselves to web services through a universal network for students. This field requires a password and other information in order to gain access.
